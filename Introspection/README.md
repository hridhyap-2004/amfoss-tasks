Why must we choose you?
~~~~~I feel like with proper direction I could do a lot more than what I have done till now.Over the years I have suprised myself with the right guidance provided by randon people + I really want to know more about how things work. I feel like amfoss would be a good platform for me to get the guidance and motivation to work harder.Choosing me in no way do I see it as a loss for th club . I am pretty confident that I can do a lot if I am part of this club.
What is your plan for the next 6 months?
~~~~~As I come from a bio- background I have been focusing myself to level-up with my classmates who have experience in coding. So far my plan was to study c++...(which I sucessfully did).But we had to study Python which felt quite easy after going through some other programming language like Java and completing the Hackerrank problem set.There are some tasks which I failed to complete. My plan is to look through them irrespective of my selection in the club to know more and in the coming years to enter in coding competitions and so on.
How would you contribute back to the club? 
~~~~~If you take me in the club I would contribute my extra hours to the club. The club also would get a strong representative in the making for sure.
Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
~~~~~It was quite good but it would have been more effevtive if the meet-ips could be offline. I know it's practically quite difficult but for newbies like myself it would have been a bit more helpful and effective to clear the doubts.
